Google Play Store Apps - Data Analysis and Prediction
Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling of app ratings in the Google Play Store. It utilizes datasets containing details about apps available on the Google Play Store and user reviews. The primary goal is to understand the factors influencing app ratings and to build a predictive model to estimate these ratings.

Datasets
googleplaystore.csv: Contains information about the apps such as category, rating, reviews, size, and more.
googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv: Includes user reviews and sentiment analysis for the apps.
Objectives
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Converting data types and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Univariate and bivariate analysis.
Visualization using histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps to uncover trends and patterns.
Feature Engineering:

Creating new features and modifying existing ones to enhance model performance.
Predictive Modeling:

Building and comparing various regression models like Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and SVR.
Evaluating models based on metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
Insights and Recommendations:

Providing actionable insights for stakeholders.
Offering strategic recommendations based on the analysis.
Methodology
Data Cleaning: Removed irrelevant and redundant data, handled missing and inconsistent values.
Data Visualization: Used plots like histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps for an in-depth analysis.
Model Training and Evaluation: Trained multiple models and performed cross-validation to ensure robustness.
Feature Engineering: Extracted and transformed features to improve model accuracy.
Tools & Technologies
Python: Primary programming language.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning and data preprocessing.
Key Findings
User reviews and app categories significantly impact app ratings.
App size and price do not strongly correlate with app ratings.
Sentiment analysis from user reviews provides valuable qualitative insights.
Random Forest Regressor performed the best among the tested models.
Conclusions
The analysis highlights the importance of user engagement and regular updates in maintaining high app ratings. Tailored strategies for different app categories and continuous data-driven decision-making are crucial for app success in the Google Play Store.
